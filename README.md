        Each card has a `'Learn More'` button that leads to a dedicated event details page when clicked.

➤  *Event Details Pages*: Clicking the `'Learn More'` button on a sports event card navigates the user to a specific event details page.
        Event details include the event name, description, image, location, date & time, and venue.
